📊 General Analytics Dashboard
This project is a Power BI dashboard that provides insightful analytics from a structured dataset. It leverages interactive visualizations and data modeling to extract key metrics and trends from the provided Dataset.csv file.

📁 Project Files
Analytics.pbix – Power BI project file containing all the data visuals, calculated measures, slicers, and dashboards.

Dataset.csv – The raw dataset used as the data source for building the analytics dashboard.

📌 Key Features
📈 Visual Insights: Data visualized using bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and KPIs.

📊 Descriptive Analytics: Summarized data trends, category-wise breakdowns, and totals.

🔍 Interactive Slicers: Users can filter the report dynamically by fields like date, category, or region.

🧠 Calculated Measures: Derived metrics and insights using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

🗂️ Data Relationships: Modeled and cleaned data for accurate visual representation and trend analysis.

🚀 How to Use
Open the .pbix file using Power BI Desktop.

Ensure Dataset.csv is present in the same folder or relink it from Power BI’s Data Source Settings.

Explore the visuals, use slicers to filter data, and interact with different elements for in-depth analysis.

💡 Insights Extracted (Example)
Identified top-performing categories based on key metrics (e.g., sales, users, or engagement).

Analyzed trends over time to find growth patterns or anomalies.

Visualized distribution of data across different regions or customer segments.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Power BI Desktop

DAX for calculated fields and measures

CSV file format for data input

🔮 Future Improvements
Integrate more datasets (e.g., customer feedback, transactions).

Add forecasting and trend lines using Power BI's analytics features.

Deploy dashboard online using Power BI Service for collaboration and sharing.
